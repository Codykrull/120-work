# HW-10 Response

## Intro
Took a bit to get back into the swing of using P5 after being gone a week, but it felt kind of nice to create in it again, even if it was stressful. I still find myself really enjoying being able to space things equally and create repeating patterns. I'll probably end up using it for most of my pieces since I find it so visually appealing. Being able to copy paste created functions is also really handy.


## Issues and Help
I found myself having troubles creating functions that had variable information such as a square function with variable settings to be injected into the base function. I think it was an issue with the arrays, but I tried and tried rewriting it with no luck, unfortunately. I also was trying to get the lines from the corners to alternate their position. To flash around the screen, but every time I tried to change it would hang up, or just sit as a static object. Not really sure what the deal with it is, but I just went with the flow and left it where it was. :/


## Future
I hope to use arrays a bit more in the future, and hopefully in the way I attend to. I just find myself having difficulties keeping up in all my classes, so sometimes I just have to call it off with the progress I've made. But I'll keep chipping away at it.
