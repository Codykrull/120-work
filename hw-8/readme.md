# HW-8 Response

## Intro
I had a lot of fun with this assignment! Loops and patterns are some of my favorite things to work with in photoshop and really any art piece. I started the assignment really liking the repeating lines that were kinked in the material. I started tweaking with the code in the web browser and liked how the lines looked when they were following the mouse location with one point, but fixated on the edge of the canvas with the other point. With that I thought it'd be cool to make a grid with multiple points spread across the entire canvas, but have the other point following the mouse. I really liked the design and texture, so I decided to add another array of lines offset and mirror both arrays on the mouse's X axis.


## Issues and Help
I didn't really have too many issues that related to this project's material. I tried a couple of experiments with the grid away with different items such as rotating squares in a grid formation, but getting the rotation around an axis without the squares moving of the entire canvas proved a bit difficult. It's something I'd like to return to in the future.


## Future
For the future I can see myself using this function a lot. Another one of my previous projects I ended up having cascading stripes, but I had to draw every individual stripe, so this function will be very helpful with similar projects and I'm excited to use this in the future.
