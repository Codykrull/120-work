# HW-3 Response

## Intro

This week was a bit more involved than last week as we learned about how ```sketch.md``` (to draw) and ```index.htm``` (webpage directory) files correlate with one another to draw and upload a creation to github and into it's very own website. This included modifications to the ```createCanvas``` variables to create a workspace in which to color the backround and apply text such as ``` "Hello world!"```.

## Issues and Help

Most of this assignement was pretty straight forward. The only bigger issue I had was as the beggining when creating the sketch for hw-3 I accidentally clicked on the wrong tab at the top of atom using the previous worked on sketch in the empty-example directory. A fair amount of my total homework time was spent on looking back at previous markdown code, some Gitbash commands, and Atom shortcuts. I noticed that Professor Musick was using shortcuts in the video to move, clone, and create comments code in the ```sketch.js``` without explaining what the shortcuts were.

Some miscellaneous things that came up was a link to view an example 404'd when I clicked on it, chrome extensions messing with the display examples on the webpage, and forgetting to save the ```sketch.js``` before refreshing the ```index.htm```. I messaged my friend Erin about the link not working, and she said that it wasn't working for her either / wasn't necessary for the lesson, so all was well. Speaking of issues, I didn't seem to see too many problems on th forum. There was someone who was having issues with internet explorer and one of the TA's recommended that he switch to another web browser. I mentioned that should he use chrome he might want to be wary of running extensions while doing the lesson plans.

## Future

Moving forward I'm excited to see what other variables we can apply to text and what other functions we could apply to the canvas. Hopefully something that interacts with keys or the mouse. I really like to think of this stuff as photoshop layers on a canvas, but with functions on a canvas made of code. Hopefully all of this and the assignment will properly post to the github to turn in!
