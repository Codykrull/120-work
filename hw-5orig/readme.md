# HW-5 Response

## Intro
I had a good (if not stumbling time) creating my piece for this week. I think there are some things that could probably have been done easier with the cascading stripes and translating multiple pieces of my previous subject to center them on the cursor and the canvas. I tried to play with things I hadn't before such as clicking variables, ```if's``` and ```arc's```. To complete this assignment I went over all the course material and videos and then decided I wanted to add to my previous ghost creation. I started with the cascading stripes searching for the appropriate code example here http://coursescript.com/notes/interactivecomputing/animation/index.html. Then I imported my previous ghost and began to center him to the cursor. After that I added the clickable Pac-man and centered him on the canvas using length and width.


## Issues and Help
Most things went pretty smoothly; it took me a little bit to get the loop to work just right on the stripes. I ended up having to add enough to fill the screen at all times before the initial stripe tied to the variable reached the end of the screen. I also had an issue disconnecting Pac-man from the ghost initially, but I moved around the cursor variable and ```push();/pull();```  until it disconnected and centered appropriately. I didn't need any help on this assignment, thankfully.


## Future
I'm hoping in the future I can become a bit more comfortable with branching out and trying new things. I do eventually, but just a little bit slower than I'd like. One of the examples in the learning material was regarding using a constant value and adding pieces to a smiley face to create a movable smiley face. I'd like to be able to work like that, but I'm a bit intimidated by the math and variable aspect, so hopefully I'll be confident enough in the future to utilize that way of drawing.
