# HW-4 Response

## Intro

This week was a good amount of fun! It was nice to breakout more of that creative side of what this program is capable of. I was a little bit nervous on this one, admittedly. The reading of how to enter ```arcs``` and ```translate``` made me think that this would be a lot harder than it was. Though I didn't end up using them in my piece I did try them out and it was relatively straight forward. Most of my decisions on this homework were to create a piece in the most efficient way, but try different things while creating to experiment.

For this assignment I watched all the videos, clicked on the links and messed with parameters on each page, trying to take a mental note of everything so that I had a good idea of what I wanted to use while working on my assignment. I basically started with the background picking one of my favorite colors to work with and the rest just kind of fell into place. I liked the idea of using a Pac-Man ghost considering we were working with arcs and thought the ghost character would stand out on the background. Though I didn't have enough time to create Pac-man himself it would be nice to add later. I started with the body/ head and tried it with a circle and a square, but remembered that you could round the corners of squares. So I ended up rounding the corners and applying the triangle feet on the bottom. Upon doing so I knew that there would be some weird lines, so I went with ```noStroke``` on the entire piece to blend the feet and the body. I could have moved the feet under the body layer too, but the blend worked well enough so it wasn't needed. After that was done I added eyes and accentuated the whites just enough with a stroke. Putting stroke elsewhere in the piece didn't add anything, so I just left it at that. I added the character name for some flavor and that was that.

## Issues and Help
There were a couple issues that I had ran into, mostly with me forgetting the opening and closing of ``` `` ``` when adding color to the functions. I just read over the code until I noticed something wasn't relating to the material. I also had some issues finding examples of fonts online, but after enough searching I found a list of available fonts that somebody had listed out and tried the one that sounded the coolest and it worked out.

I went on the issue forum to see if anyone needed help, but since I end up getting to this stuff pretty late there wasn't really anything to help. Not only because of when I looked, but also because it seemed to be a pretty issue free week for the class, which is excellent to see. I did notice people were creating a group though, so that's really cool.


## Future

Looking ahead I'm excited to see what we can do to make these things that we make a little more interactive, in terms of visual effects, movements, behaviors etc. As I was looking for a font I found this interesting line of code on the P5.js website that showed how to make text that runs away from your mouse! Unfortunately I ended up accidentally deleting the tab at some point, so I can't link it here, but it was exciting to see the potential there.
