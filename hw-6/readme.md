# HW-6 Response

## Intro
This week was very, very difficult for me, I can't lie. I tried very hard and ended up making something I'm not particularly proud of. I've never been much of a math person, so that doesn't help, that mixed with code occasionally not working was just a nightmare. For this project I went over all of the material several times, tested out my own lines and tried to place them in a way that was aesthetically pleasing, then I tried different variables, executed and repeated. I watched a lot of videos from the coding train, and tried to search for my own solutions with varying chances of success.


## Issues and Help
I could not for the life of me get the constrain function to work. I'm really not sure what the problem was. I tried my own code, copy pasting code from the forum, changing numerous variables and labeling, nothing could make it run with the constraint. I thought about posting to the forum, but this assignment was such a headache and I was so far behind I couldn't bring myself to post about it feeling bad about everything. I checked the forum and online for solutions but kept coming up with the same code I was using, so I probably had a small mistake somewhere that was throwing a wrench into the piece, unfortunately. I had deleted the code, and then tried to replace the code to show what I was doing for you guys to see what I'm talking about, hopefully it makes a bit more sense, I dunno.


## Future
I'm honestly pretty nervous about the future considering how difficult this was for me. I'm hoping to keep chugging along in the homework and hopefully things will click eventually.
