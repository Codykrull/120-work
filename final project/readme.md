# Final Project Proposal

For my final creative coding project I'd like to create a brick breaker style of game. One where the ball is un-moving, but once the user clicks sends the ball into motion destroying bricks on the end of the screen. I would also like to implement possible number of times that bricks have to be hit, so one set might take 1 hit, while the set farther away might take 2 hits for the ball

## Issues
I'm expecting issues with giving the bricks a theoretical health bar before disappearing, I'll try my best, but I am a little nervous about even tackling it. The same thing goes for getting rid of bricks in a couple of arrays, I'm expecting some issue. I'd also like to implement music or external photos in some fashion. Though I think a strong color pallet might just work for that, I'll play around and see what I can form.


## Timeline

As I'm still finishing a couple of previous projects for the class I'm going to get those done so that I have more tools for the final project. I'm hoping with the next pieces I finish up I'll have a bit more flair to add to this project, but at this point my main goal is to have a working game that plays just like classic brick breaker. So after I finish the interacting objects homework I can start getting the game in a working condition hopefully by the mid weekend; then adding visual and (hopefully) sound flair. If not that, troubleshooting the game until it's in a workable state.
